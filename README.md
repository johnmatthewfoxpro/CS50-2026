# CS50

Harvards acclaimed computer science course. 

## DESCRIPTION

I initially began this course in 2025, however due to commitments to other courses and college I failed to complete the work.  
As such I've returned with the new release of CS50-2026 to staret again with a fresh perspective.  

This respository will serve as a progress report and archive of the work I submit. The idea being to develope my skills of completing readme's and using git.

## INSTRUCTIONS

The course runs for 11 weeks, starting at week 0, and includes a final project.  

Inside this repo you will find, once they are completed, all the work I submit and additional programs I write in support of those projects. Each weeks work will be in it's
own directory with dedicated readme and folder structure for that specific project.
