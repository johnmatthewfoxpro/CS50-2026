## DESCRIPTION

A short submission of CS50's week 0 content. Herein I recreated the code of 2 basic programs presented in the lecture and I have also included my scratch game submission from problem set 0. 

## INSTRUCTIONS

To play "Paindamonium: 2 MUCH PAIN" you can download the .sb3 file in problem_set_0 and load it to a blank project in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). Alternatively, follow the link [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1202946719/) to play my game direct on Scratch.

Once there you can you can hit the 'green flag' to play the game. The instructions are below.

`**Mouse Required!**

`Use your cat speed and cunning to repel the hungry rats by launching baguettes at their little faces. 
 
This is a highly anticipated sequal to Paindamonium.
2 MUCH PAIN includes much requested special Rats and a handy flour bomb!

WASD to move, aiming with mouse and left click to shoot breadsticks at the enemy. If you find flour bombs, you can use them by hitting F.

Rats will constantly spawn so weapons free Mr Whiskers. Bread will appear and heal you if you take too much damage.

50 points to win but rats will keep spawning until you are defeated, go for that HIGHSCORE!

CURRENT SCOREBOARD: 
Trashdemon27 - 118
